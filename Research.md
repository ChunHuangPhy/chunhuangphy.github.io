My research interests have evolved significantly from my undergraduate studies to my PhD, as I have actively explored various areas within astrophysics and physics. Below, I outline my primary research areas, highlighting my contributions and collaborations.

## 1. Glitch Dynamics

Pulsar glitches are fundamental phenomena characterized by sudden increases in a pulsar's spin rate. These abrupt changes are typically accompanied by phenomena such as delayed spin-up and persistent shifts in the spin-down rate. To investigate these dynamics, I have delved into the literature and analyzed radio observation data of the Crab pulsar's glitches. In collaboration with Prof. Xiaoping Zheng at Central China Normal University, my work focuses on examining different theoretical models of pulsar glitches through data analysis.

Additionally, I am interested in the theoretical modeling of glitch behavior using superfluid theory. Part of my undergraduate thesis is dedicated to this topic, where we examine past starquake models with new datasets. This work is currently being prepared for publication.

## 2. Bayesian Inference of Equation of State

I have developed a strong interest in applying mass-radius measurements and other astrophysical constraints to determine the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. My research is among the first to apply these constraints to physics-motivated EOS models using Bayesian inference. Collaborating with Prof. Anna Watts and her group, as well as nuclear physicists such as Prof. Laura Tolos and Prof. Constança Providência, I have focused on applying Bayesian inference to Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) theory models.

**Key Publications:**
- **Chun Huang**, Geert Raaijmakers, Anna Watts, Laura Tolos, Constança Providência, “Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass–radius measurements I: nucleonic models”, *MNRAS* (2023).
- **Chun Huang**, Laura Tolos, Constança Providência, and Anna Watts, “[Constraining fundamental nuclear physics parameters using neutron star mass-radius measurements II: Hyperonic models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14572)”, arXiv:2410.14572 (2024), submitted to *MNRAS*.

This research started during the pandemic and has spanned a significant period. I attended a summer school at Northwestern University, where I developed a Bayesian inference package named [**CompactObject**](https://github.com/ChunHuangPhy/CompactObject). This open-source package is designed for Bayesian inference on EOS constraints, featuring a user-friendly and extensible structure. Initially led by me, the project has since expanded through collaborations with researchers from the EU, China, and Washington University. The package now supports seven different EOS models, ranging from phenomenological to meta-models, making it a powerful tool in the community.

Chen, Laura Tolos, and Anna Watts, “[CompactObject: An open-source Python package for full-scope neutron star equation of state inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14615)”, arXiv:2411.14615 (2024), submitted to *JOSS*.

The survey paper on CompactObject is currently in progress. I have also utilized this package to assist physicists worldwide in inferring various EOS models.

**Additional Collaboration:**
- Wenli Yuan, **Chun Huang**, Chen Zhang, Enping Zhou, Renxin Xu, “[Bayesian inference of strangeon matter using the new measurement of J0437-4751 and GW190814](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14938)”, arXiv:2411.14938 (2024), submitted to *PRD*.

Ongoing collaborations aim to constrain dark matter, nuclear parameterized EOS, and phase transitions.

## 3. Inference Methods Independent of Equation of State Assumptions

This emerging field represents a significant expansion of my research portfolio. I have developed novel tools and approaches to analyze observational data independently of EOS assumptions, addressing common critiques when presenting my work. This method allows for the inference of critical quantities that are of broad interest across various physics communities, including nuclear physics, gravitational wave physics, and astrophysics.

This research has culminated in my first single-author paper, marking my establishment as an independent researcher in this field.

**Key Publication:**
- **Chun Huang**, “[Equation of State Independent Determination on the Radius of a 1.4 Neutron Star Using Mass-Radius Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18432)”, arXiv:2409.18432 (2024), submitted to *ApJ Letters*.

Further work in EOS-independent inference is underway, in collaboration with an undergraduate student at Washington University and Prof. Alex Chen.
