title: "Who am I"
---

I am a third-year PhD candidate in the [Physics and Astronomy Department at Washington University in St. Louis](https://physics.wustl.edu) working with [Alex Chen](https://physics.wustl.edu/people/alex-chen), [Yajie Yuan](https://physics.wustl.edu/people/yajie-yuan), and [Michael Nowak](https://physics.wustl.edu/people/michael-nowak). I am currently interested in constructing a physical understanding of X-ray hotspot configurations using X-ray timing data from [NICER](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/) and [XMM-Newton](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton). Additionally, I utilize the inferred mass-radius measurements from these analyses, along with multimessenger observations and nuclear physics input, to constrain the neutron star interior.

Before coming to the US to pursue my PhD, I completed my undergraduate studies in the [Physics Department at Central China Normal University](http://physics.ccnu.edu.cn/English.htm). I also worked remotely with the XPSI group at the University of Amsterdam as an Undergraduate Intern under [Prof. Anna Watts](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.l.watts/).
