I am a third-year PhD candidate in the [Physics and Astronomy department Washington University in St Louis]{https://physics.wustl.edu} work with [Alex Chen]{https://physics.wustl.edu/people/alex-chen}, [Yajie Yuan]{https://physics.wustl.edu/people/yajie-yuan} and [Micheal Nowak]{https://physics.wustl.edu/people/michael-nowak}, I am currently interested in Constructing a physical understanding of X-ray hotspot configuration by X-ray timing data from [NICER]{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/} and [XMM-Newton]{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton} and use the inferred Mass-Radius measurements from these analysis plus multimessenger observations and nuclear physics input to constrain Neutron star interior.

Before I came to US to persue my PhD, I completed my undergraduate study in [Physics department in Central China Normal University]{http://physics.ccnu.edu.cn/English.htm}, I have worked remotely with XPSI group in University of Amsterdam as a Undergraduate Internship with [Prof. Anna Watts]{https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.l.watts/}.
